Please provide the previously extracted entity types and relationships, and I'll ensure any new extractions strictly adhere to those categories.

Share the existing schema, and I’ll add missing entities/relationships in the same format.  \n\nAlternatively, if you’d like me to proceed with hypothetical types, let me know!  \n\n*(Note: Without the prior schema, I’ll avoid guessing to prevent inconsistency.)*", "refusal": null, "role": "assistant", "annotations": null, "audio": null, "function_call": null, "tool_calls": null}}], "created": 1746707372, "model": "deepseek-ai/DeepSeek-V3", "object": "chat.completion", "service_tier": null, "system_fingerprint": "", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 167, "prompt_tokens": 37, "total_tokens": 204, "completion_tokens_details": null, "prompt_tokens_details": null}}, "input": {"messages": [{"content": "MANY entities and relationships were missed in the last extraction.
